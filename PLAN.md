# LLM Browser Automation Extension - Development Plan

Roadmap / TODO:

- recursive LLM scripting: have an LLM generate saveable scripts that can also call an LLM, so incorporating the alt text generator as an example would be perfect
- see chat history
- do actions
- save complex function call sequence into action scripts
- remove clear()
- system prompt with and without tools
- tool parameters to choose number of items / length to return, paging, and reporting how much there is
