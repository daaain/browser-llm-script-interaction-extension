# LLM Browser Automation Extension - Development Plan

Roadmap / TODO:

- recursive LLM scripting: have an LLM generate saveable scripts that can also call an LLM, so incorporating the alt text generator as an example would be perfect
- see chat history
- do actions
- save complex function call sequence into action scripts
- remove clear()
- system prompt with and without tools
- tool parameters to choose number of items / length to return, paging, and reporting how much there is
- replace function test buttons with full list of functions and way to manually call any of them
- tutorial / welcome screen
- handle text selection - add to context with little popup? that could also trigger opening the sidebar?
- maybe also right click context menu element selection for interaction?
